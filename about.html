        <h2>What benefits do cats provide?</h2>
        <p>Owning a cat can be an extremely rewarding relationship. A cat has the ability to both calm your nervous system and provide an immediate outlet for fun and play. Although cats are independent animals who like to scavenge and explore on their own terms, they are also very affectionate with their owners and people they trust.</p>

    </p> Most cats love to curl up in your lap at the end of a long day while you watch television or read a book. The simplicity of this act can cause an automatic release of all the right kinds of chemicals to your brain, allowing you to ease into the evening without the weight of the world on your shoulders. Any cat owner will tell you just how much their furry friend helps them to relax and unwind. While many people enjoy the company of dogs, a cat can be more of an acquired taste—but once acquired, it’s a hard taste to lose.</p>

    <h3>Here are some pros</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Cats are low maintenance.</b> Maybe cats’ most alluring quality is that they are lower maintenance and cost less than dogs, who need walking, training, frequent grooming, and more toys and attention. Cats are also perfect for apartments or city living. They don’t need tons of space to play and explore—nosing their way through the nooks and crannies of your kitchen will keep them occupied for hours.</li> 
            <br>
        <li><b>They’re quiet.</b> Cats tend to meow when they’re hungry, but you rarely have to worry about being woken up or distracted from a task by a cat begging for attention. This makes them an ideal pet if you’re working from home or have youngsters napping during the day, for example.</li>
            <br>
        <li><b>They’re independent.</b> A cat will be there for you when you need them but they’re also perfectly adept at entertaining themselves. Most don’t need—or want—constant attention and you’ll never have to endure guilt-inducing puppy eyes from a cat.</li>
            <br>
        <li><b>They keep your house pest-free.</b> You probably already know that cats like to hunt rodents. But they’re also natural insect killers, too, offering the kind of household protection that Venus flytraps promise but rarely deliver. Many cats thoroughly enjoy exterminating bugs such as house flies and spiders, almost like they’re being paid for it.</li>
            <br>
        <li><b>They have long life spans.</b> The most difficult stage of pet ownership is parting with your beloved companion. While you’re still likely to outlive a cat, their longer lifespans mean you’ll get to have more time with them—up to 20 years, in fact.</li>

        <h2>Some of these inconveniences include:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Allergies:</b> Some people are allergic to cats, which can make it difficult to own one.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Destructive behavior:</b> Cats can be destructive, especially if they're bored. It's important to provide your cat with plenty of toys and activities to keep them entertained.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Health problems:</b> Cats can suffer from a variety of health problems, some of which can be expensive to treat. It's important to take your cat to the vet for regular checkups to catch any problems early on.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Litter box:</b> Cats need a litter box to use the bathroom, which can be messy and smelly. It's important to clean the litter box regularly to avoid unpleasant odors.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Shedding:</b> Cats shed fur, which can be a nuisance to clean up. Some breeds shed more than others, so it's important to do your research before choosing a cat.</li>
        </ul>
